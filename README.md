Tired of pressing enter and sending a message instead of getting a newline?
NO MORE!

This script works when using Chrome (but you can change "Chrome" with any other browser, just replace the name in the script

If Chrome is open + a tab is open with "Claude" or "Chatgpt" (again you can change this to anything you like) Then:

Press Shift+Enter to send Shift+Enter (newline)
Press Shift+Enter to send Enter (send message)

That's it. Bye.
