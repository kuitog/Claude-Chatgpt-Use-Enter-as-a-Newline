Tired of pressing enter and sending a message instead of getting a newline?
NO MORE!

This script works when using Chrome (but you can change "Chrome" with any other browser, just replace the name in the script

If Chrome is open + a tab is open with "Claude" or "Chatgpt" (again you can change this to anything you like) Then:

Press Shift+Enter to send Shift+Enter (newline)
Press Shift+Enter to send Enter (send message)


Note: I used Pageup - Enter - Pagedown instead of Shift+enter because in autoit it caused a glitch in windows where the shift button stays stuck until system restart.
AHK didn't demonstrate this problem, but I changed it also there.

Known bug: if enter is pressed extremely fast in rapid succession -> enter is actually sent!
This could be useful if you don't want to press shift+enter to send a message --> just press enter twice rapidly!

That's it. Bye.
